## Obsidian Weekly Note Themes

A series of themes for weekly notes, different colors for different weeks. Each week is a new adventure with its own color adapted from the Daily Notes theme.

### Installation and configuration

To use this theme, you need to have the latest version of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plus the [Templarer](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) plugin from the Obsidian plugin store installation steps.

- Download or clone the repository, or directly extract the CSS snippet and templates.
	- Move [Weekly Note Themes.css](https://github.com/Usergh0st/Obsidian-Weekly-Themes/blob/main/Weekly%20Note%20Themes.css "Weekly Note Themes.css") to `.obsidian/snippets` folder.
	- Go to obsidian settings, Appearance, CSS snippets, and enable this snippet.
	- Download the plugin [Templarer](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) and set your folder location templates.
	- In that templates folder you should have the template you downloaded from the repository called [Template_weekly_note_english.md](https://github.com/Usergh0st/Obsidian-Weekly-Themes/blob/main/Template_weekly_note_english.md "Template_weekly_note_english.md")
